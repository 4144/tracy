ok lets think about his

We just need to do one thing

Fist we need to scan over any request going to the server and from the server

When going to the server we want to look for are keyword and use this to generate
are payload to send to the server. We then need to add this to some kind of
registry to be used by the other webserver.

This other webserver will just be used by the web browser to gain information
about what has been registered so that it can look for responses
