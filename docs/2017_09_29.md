# 2017-09-29 Pre-Research Week Planning

## Plugin

* 8) Better hooking (Michael)
  * More functions
  * Better messaging
    * Remove hard-coded ID
    * There's a function to get a plugin's ID
* Batch submit
  * Currently the APIs are called for each Tracer ID
  * A better way would be to do them all together, instead of each time you see
    one
* De-dupe DOM
  * There's a bug where at the beginning it fires the DOM-write event a whole
    bunch of times for each element
  * You see `body`, `div`, etc.
* Better search
  * Michael has an alg to solve searching through and finding tokens more
    efficiently
* 3) Input box button (Jake)
  * Probably doesn't have to run in user land, can run in plugin context
  * Michael has found some resources on how to do that
* 2) Config UI (Jake)
  * The ability to disable/enable the plugin, make it button on the corner -
    next to URL bar in Chrome
  * Maybe have a settings page that lets people specify URL to proxy server
* New tracer delta? (not immediate goal, hold for now)
  * API for only getting the newest set of tracers 
* 1a) New APIs for plugin server (Jake)

## Proxy

* Better HTTPS handling (code cleanup)
  * Low priority, current code is hacky
  * To track what the protocol is, he does a weird hack to just read the first
    few bytes and then sets a string...
* Better token handling
  * Better alg for finding/replacing the tokens on the proxy
* Better token to server (lower priority)
  * Same as batch submit for plugin - currently for each token it sends a
    separate request, when the proxy replaces the token, it sends a request to
    the server "I have added a token to this request"
  * Currently 1 request per token, should just batch them
* 2) Response checking for token (Michael)
  * Currently the proxy doesn't look in the response for tokens
* 1) Make it work with the new api (Michael)

## API Server

* Missing API
  * Michael - it feels like we're probably missing APIs, we'll find out what.
* 6) UI (Jake)
  * Minimal base
* 5) Roll the server into the proxy (Jake)
  * Make the server and the go proxy the same process
* 7) Missing data (Michael)
  * Like response type (MIME-type)
  * Would be good to log the data type that's returned by the server in
    responses
  * This would be really good for Angular template injection
