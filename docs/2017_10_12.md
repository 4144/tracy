# 2017/10/12 - Thursday of Week 2, Demo at Consultant Meetup

Kristin, Jack, France, and Clint in attendance, in addition to Michael Roberts
and Jake.

The demo ends with a standing ovation, and Jack shed a single tear of joy.

## Future Improvements

* [ ] Test performance characteristics on frontend heavy sites
* [ ] In the plugin that hooks DOM events, gather additional info of the context of the event
  * e.g. Is this happening in an `href`, etc.
* [ ] Test it out on the XSS shooting range
* [ ] Get hooking `eval` working (and `setTimeout`, etc)
* [ ] Make installing easier/faster
* [ ] Searching tracers better
* [ ] Tracer view page auto-refreshing
* [ ] Automatically check if observed tracer is almost definitely exploitable, inform user
  * Tracer not encoded at all
  * Quotes not encoded in an href
  * Tracer going to `eval` or other fxns that are guaranteed XSS
* [ ] How to de-dupe?
  * This is important, lots of similar results

### Friday
* [ ] Update README and make it clear how to get it set up and run the tool
* [ ] Do some asciicasts to show usage


### Long term

* [ ] Collect session info and keep track of which user put a tracer in
  * If you see data input into one site getting leaked into another site
* [ ] Maybe add these payloads into spider, have them input it automatically
  * You can create extensions that use the spider engine
