# Notes 2017/10/10

* [ ] Jake - update UI so that it's less frustrating to use
  * Potentially have arrows on the side that make it easy to jump from one thing
    to the next, or keyboard shortcuts
* [ ] Michael - allow custom tags `{{xss}}`, `{{plaintext}}`, etc.
* [ ] Test performance characteristics on frontend heavy sites
* [ ] In the plugin that hooks DOM events, gather additional info of the context of the event
  * e.g. Is this happening in an `href`, etc.
* [ ] Test it out on the XSS shooting range

Friday
* [ ] Update README and make it clear how to get it set up and run the tool
